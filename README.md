### For Users

- [CLI](https://github.com/maidsafe/autonomi/blob/main/ant-cli/README.md) The client command line
  interface that enables users to interact with the network from their terminal.
- [Node](https://github.com/maidsafe/autonomi/blob/main/ant-node/README.md) The backbone of the
  Autonomi network. Nodes can run on commodity hardware and provide storage space and validate
  transactions on the network.
- Web App: Coming Soon!

#### Building the Node from Source

If you wish to build a version of `antnode` from source, some special consideration must be given
if you want it to connect to the current beta network.

You should build from the `stable` branch, as follows:

```
git checkout stable
cargo build --release --bin antnode
```

#### Running the Node

To run a node and receive rewards, you need to specify your Ethereum address as a parameter. Rewards are paid to the specified address.

```
cargo run --release --bin antnode -- --rewards-address <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS_TO_RECEIVE_REWARDS>
```

### Using a Local Network

We can explore the network's features by using multiple node processes to form a local network. We
also need to run a local EVM network for our nodes and client to connect to.

Follow these steps to create a local network:

##### 1. Prerequisites

The latest version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) should be installed. If you already have an installation, use `rustup update` to get the latest version.

Run all the commands from the root of this repository.

If you haven't already, install Foundry. We need to have access to Anvil, which is packaged with Foundry, to run an EVM node: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

To collect rewards for you nodes, you will need an EVM address, you can create one using [metamask](https://metamask.io/).

##### 2. Run a local EVM node

```sh
cargo run --bin evm-testnet
```

This creates a CSV file with the EVM network params in your data directory.

##### 3. Create the test network and pass the EVM params
   `--rewards-address` _is the address where you will receive your node earnings on._

```bash
cargo run --bin antctl -- local run --build --clean --rewards-address <YOUR_ETHEREUM_ADDRESS>
```

The EVM Network parameters are loaded from the CSV file in your data directory automatically when the `local` mode is enabled.

##### 4. Verify node status

```bash
cargo run --bin antctl -- status
```

The Antctl `run` command starts the node processes. The `status` command should show twenty-five
running nodes.

##### 5. Uploading and Downloading Data

To upload a file or a directory, you need to set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to your EVM secret key:

> When running a local network, you can use the `SECRET_KEY` printed by the `evm-testnet` command [step 2](#2-run-a-local-evm-node) as it has all the money.

```bash
SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_EVM_SECRET_KEY> cargo run --bin ant -- --local file upload <path>
```

The output will print out the address at which the content was uploaded.

Now to download the files again:

```bash
cargo run --bin ant -- --local file download <addr> <dest_path>
```

### RPC

The node manager launches each node process with a remote procedure call (RPC) service. The
workspace has a client binary that can be used to run commands against these services.

Run the `status` command with the `--details` flag to get the RPC port for each node:

```
$ cargo run --bin antctl -- status --details
...
===================================
antctl-local25 - RUNNING

Version: 0.103.21
Peer ID: 12D3KooWJ4Yp8CjrbuUyeLDsAgMfCb3GAYMoBvJCRp1axjHr9cf8
Port: 38835
RPC Port: 34416
Multiaddr: /ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/38835/quic-v1/p2p/12D3KooWJ4Yp8CjrbuUyeLDsAgMfCb3GAYMoBvJCRp1axjHr9cf8

Bin path: target/release/antnode
Connected peers: 24
```

Now you can run RPC commands against any node.

The `info` command will retrieve basic information about the node:

```
$ cargo run --bin antnode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:34416 info
Node info:
==========
RPC endpoint: https://127.0.0.1:34416
Peer Id: 12D3KooWJ4Yp8CjrbuUyeLDsAgMfCb3GAYMoBvJCRp1axjHr9cf8

PID: 62369
Binary version: 0.103.21
Time since last restart: 1614s
```

The `netinfo` command will return connected peers and listeners:

```
$ cargo run --bin antnode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:34416 netinfo
Node's connections to the Network:

Connected peers:

Node's listeners:
Listener: /ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/38835/quic-v1
Listener: /ip4/192.168.1.86/udp/38835/quic-v1

Listener: /ip4/172.18.0.1/udp/38835/quic-v1
Listener: /ip4/172.20.0.1/udp/38835/quic-v1
```

Node control commands:

```
$ cargo run --bin antnode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:34416 restart 5000
Node successfully received the request to restart in 5s

$ cargo run --bin antnode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:34416 stop 6000
Node successfully received the request to stop in 6s

$ cargo run --bin antnode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:34416 update 7000
Node successfully received the request to try to update in 7s
```

NOTE: it is preferable to use the node manager to control the node rather than RPC commands.

### Tear Down

When you're finished experimenting, tear down the network:

```bash
cargo run --bin antctl -- local kill
```

## Metrics Dashboard

Use the `open-metrics` feature flag on the node / client to start
an [OpenMetrics](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/) exporter. The metrics are
served via a webserver started at a random port. Check the log file / stdout to find the webserver
URL, `Metrics server on http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/metrics`

The metrics can then be collected using a collector (for e.g. Prometheus) and the data can then be
imported into any visualization tool (for e.g., Grafana) to be further analyzed. Refer to
this [Guide](./metrics/README.md) to easily setup a dockerized Grafana dashboard to visualize the
metrics.
