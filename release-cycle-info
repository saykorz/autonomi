# The reason for having the year and month here rather than reading it from the OS is because we
# have two cycles per month, but the RC can be built for the first cycle of the following month, in
# the current month. So for example, you could build the first September RC before the month of
# August ends, hence reading the current date from the OS would give you 08 rather than 09. The same
# thing applies to the year. So, it's simple enough to just define them here.
#
# The release-cycle is the cycle within the current month. It will be 1 or 2. It is set at the
# beginning of the cycle.
#
# The release-cycle-counter is initially set to 1 at the beginning of each cycle, and during the
# cycle, it will be incremented for each RC build.
#
# Both of these numbers are used in the packaged version number, which is a collective version
# number for all the released binaries.
