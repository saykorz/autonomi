# Maid Token Supply level server


Rides atop the goodwill of https://emaid.online/api and caches results for `emaid` and `maid` tokens 
in order to provide a simple API that websites can use to check the current supply levels easily.


http://<address>:3030/maid

and 

http://<address>:3030/emaid

Should both return _only_ the current supply level of the token in question.
